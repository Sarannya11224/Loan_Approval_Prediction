# Loan_Approval_Prediction
Analyzing Loan Eligibility Based on Applicant Characteristics
Executive Summary:
This case study explores key factors affecting loan eligibility, focusing on features like education level, self-employment status, annual income, and credit history (CIBIL score). By analyzing these features and building a predictive model, the study aims to help financial institutions better assess loan applications. Using logistic regression,random forest, and SVC the analysis identifies critical factors that influence loan approval.

Introduction/Background:
Financial institutions often evaluate various factors, such as education, income, employment type, and assets, when determining whether to approve or reject loan applications. This case study will analyze a dataset from a financial institution to determine the key factors influencing loan eligibility. Our goal is to create a predictive model to automate loan approval based on applicant characteristics.

Objective:
To identify factors that predict loan eligibility and build a machine learning model to streamline the loan approval process.

Dataset Source:
The dataset contains information on loan applicants, including variables like education, income, employment status, credit score, and various asset values.

Hypotheses:
Applicants with higher income and education levels are more likely to be approved for loans. Self-employed applicants may face more scrutiny and have lower approval rates. A higher credit score (CIBIL score) will strongly predict loan approval. Assets like residential, commercial, and luxury assets may play a role in loan eligibility.
